# algorithmic-problem-solving
This repsoitory contains the solutions to some problem Professor Joanna Klukowska, who taught Algorithmic Problem Solving in New York University.  The problems' difficulty range from easy to medium and cover topics such as data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, and graph theory.  
This repository also contains sample code for graph theory algorithms, which are mostly from GeeksForGeeks.

* **Note:** All problems are solved in C++*
